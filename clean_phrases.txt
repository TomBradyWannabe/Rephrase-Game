a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
the best of both worlds
spill the beans
time is money
a rolling stone gathers no moss
absence makes the heart grow fonder
you can't have your cake and eat it too
you reap what you sow
pull someone's leg
easy come easy go
down to the wire
keep your nose to the grindstone
take it with a grain of salt
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
when the going gets tough the tough get going
fortune favors the bold
no pain no gain
lose your touch
throw caution to the wind
practice makes perfect
a watched pot never boils
a fool and his money are soon parted
cost an arm and a leg
get a second wind
no news is good news
beat around the bush
sleep on it
a blessing in disguise
if it ain't broke don't fix it
hit the sack
leave no stone unturned
there’s no time like the present
money doesn't grow on trees
let bygones be bygones
it takes two to tango
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
the early bird catches the worm
rain on your parade
the more the merrier
Rome wasn't built in a day
beggars can't be choosers
the ends justify the means
see eye to eye
think outside the box
the pen is mightier than the sword
cut to the chase
the grass is always greener on the other side
throw in the towel
live and let live
go the extra mile
too many cooks spoil the broth
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
speak of the devil
put your foot down
you can't always get what you want
love is blind
get out of hand
under your nose
one man's trash is another man's treasure
know the ropes
let your hair down
a leopard can't change its spots
the last straw
if you can't beat them join them
make ends meet
weather the storm
in hot water
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
go out on a limb
actions speak louder than words
you can say that again
wear your heart on your sleeve
burn the midnight oil
no man is an island
don't rock the boat
jack of all trades master of none
a picture is worth a thousand words
don't burn your bridges
jump on the bandwagon
bite the bullet
there's no such thing as a free lunch
birds of a feather flock together
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
have a chip on your shoulder
don't cry over spilled milk
don't judge a book by its cover
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
it is what it is
read between the lines
don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today
scratch the surface
piece of cake
blood is thicker than water
out of sight out of mind
toe the line
a stitch in time saves nine
bend over backwards
barking up the wrong tree
steal someone's thunder
wrap your head around it
haste makes waste
walk on eggshells
there's no place like home
in the nick of time
turn over a new leaf
make a long story short
under the weather
go back to the drawing board
when in Rome do as the Romans do
throw your hat into the ring
look before you leap
don't bite the hand that feeds you
sit on the fence
keep your chin up
break the ice
every cloud has a silver lining
put all your eggs in one basket
better safe than sorry
the pot calling the kettle black
on thin ice
slow and steady wins the race
ignorance is bliss
hit the nail on the head
curiosity killed the cat
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
stick your neck out
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
don't count your chickens before they hatch
two heads are better than one
don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
play it by ear
off the beaten path
once in a blue moon
all bark and no bite
let sleeping dogs lie
your guess is as good as mine
jump the gun
call it a day
not playing with a full deck
up in the air
time flies when you're having fun
give the benefit of the doubt
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
take a rain check
two wrongs don't make a right
honesty is the best policy
let the cat out of the bag
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
the best of both worlds
spill the beans
time is money
a rolling stone gathers no moss
absence makes the heart grow fonder
you can't have your cake and eat it too
