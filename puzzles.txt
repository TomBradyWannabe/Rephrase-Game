the best of both worlds
spill the beans
time is money
you reap what you sow
pull someone's leg
easy come easy go
down to the wire
fortune favors the bold
no pain no gain
lose your touch
throw caution to the wind
practice makes perfect
a watched pot never boils
cost an arm and a leg
get a second wind
no news is good news
beat around the bush
sleep on it
a blessing in disguise
hit the sack
leave no stone unturned
let bygones be bygones
it takes two to tango
rain on your parade
the more the merrier
Rome wasn't built in a day
beggars can't be choosers
think outside the box
cut to the chase
throw in the towel
live and let live
go the extra mile
speak of the devil
put your foot down
love is blind
get out of hand
under your nose
know the ropes
let your hair down
the last straw
make ends meet
weather the storm
in hot water
go out on a limb
you can say that again
burn the midnight oil
no man is an island
don't rock the boat
jump on the bandwagon
bite the bullet
it is what it is
read between the lines
scratch the surface
piece of cake
out of sight out of mind
toe the line
bend over backwards
barking up the wrong tree
steal someone's thunder
wrap your head around it
walk on eggshells
there's no place like home
in the nick of time
turn over a new leaf
make a long story short
under the weather
look before you leap
sit on the fence
keep your chin up
better safe than sorry
on thin ice
ignorance is bliss
hit the nail on the head
curiosity killed the cat
stick your neck out
play it by ear
off the beaten path
once in a blue moon
all bark and no bite
let sleeping dogs lie
jump the gun
call it a day
up in the air
take a rain check
let the cat out of the bag
the best of both worlds
spill the beans
time is money
you reap what you sow
pull someone's leg
easy come easy go
down to the wire
fortune favors the bold
no pain no gain
lose your touch
throw caution to the wind
practice makes perfect
a watched pot never boils
cost an arm and a leg
